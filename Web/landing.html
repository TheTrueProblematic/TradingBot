        Power Cloud is working hard to accomplish our goal of providing affordable, uncompressed, and reliable online storage to those in our communities. Many users face problems with compression and online storage, and we aim to fix this. Compression is a process that shrinks the size of files, at a significant cost to their quality. This process is very common and is used by many popular web storage solutions, such as Google Drive. Power cloud provides a solution where data will never be  compressed at a cost much lower than that of solutions like Onedrive and iCloud. You are the priority at Power Cloud which is why we offer free services like our <a href = "protips.html">pro internet tips!</a> We are also dedicated to privacy and we will never share your information to <b>ANYONE</b>.
